        <p>A priestly champion who wields divine magic in service of a higher power</p>
      </aside>
      <p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke
         awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers 
         who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power 
         of the gods on their side.</p>

      </aside>
      <p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what 
        principles you want your character to embody. The Gods of the Multiverse section includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. 
        Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.
        
        Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose 
        you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a 
        troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself 
        worthy of a great quest?<p></p>
