        <p>With its great charisma, their voice becomes their greatest weapon.</p>
      </aside>
      <p>In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is 
        a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words 
        of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music 
        of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p>

          <img id="bard-intro-logo" src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/4808/188/340/340/636771210370826107.png">
      </aside>
      <p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to 
        learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity 
        to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to 
        strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can 
        tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about 
        heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p>
