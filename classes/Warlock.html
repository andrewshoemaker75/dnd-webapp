      </aside>
      <p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, 
        giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a
        few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p>
      <aside>
        <p>The relentless combatant, fueled by fury or it's totem bonds with animals. In tune with the natural order.</p>
      </aside>
      <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world.
        Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger 
        in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?
        What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join 
        forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your 
        homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands
        and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you 
        committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p>
